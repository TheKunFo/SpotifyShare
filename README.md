# SpotifyShare
SpotifyPlaylistShare is a full-stack app that lets users create custom playlists (stored in our database) and populate them with songs fetched from the Spotify API. Users can search for tracks via the API, add them to their own playlists, and make those playlists viewable and “likeable” by other users.
